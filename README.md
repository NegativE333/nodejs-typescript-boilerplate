# TypeScript with Node.js Starter
This is a simple starter project to help you get up and running with TypeScript and Node.js for building server-side applications.

## Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installing
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NegativE333/nodejs-typescript-boilerplate.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd nodejs-with-typescript
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Application
To run the application in development mode with automatic TypeScript compilation and server restart:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This command starts the server on port 8000 and watches for changes in your TypeScript files.

To run the application in production mode:
```bash
npm start
```
This command compiles your TypeScript files and starts the server.
